     * This still needs to be developed.
     * The difference with a collectable is that the interactable is either a npc
     * or a gameobject, and it's got a collider in both cases, so the player can't
     * walk through it. Also, to interact with it, the player doesn't need to trigger
     * the object/npc, but only to be in within a certain radius from it and then press a key.
     *
     * This should be used to start dialogs with NPCs, or to show text on screen when interacting with
     * (could be?) a ancient ruin with some helpful writings on it, and more.
