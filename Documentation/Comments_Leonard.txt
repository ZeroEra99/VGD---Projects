OVERALL:
I dont know how it is for you or if that only happens because it is in the dev environment
but if I run the game and turn my mouse a bit too fast the screen starts jumping a bit. Maybe we have to
adjust some frame/update rate to stop that.

CAMERA:
Pretty slick!
something I especially noticed was how it is able to adjust its distance depending on the speed the player is going at.
Pretty nice.
Other than that I have no idea what is and what is not important since I did not dig into the topic that deep. But I
appreciate you giving so much effort to getting a nicely working rotational view!
